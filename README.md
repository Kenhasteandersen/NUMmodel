# NUMmodel
Implementation of the **Nutrient-Unicellular-Multicellular**
modelling framework as using in Soper-Eckford et al (2021) (in prep).  The model principles are described in: Serra-Pompei et al (2020): [A general size- and trait-based model of plankton communities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346939727_A_general_size-_and_trait-based_model_of_plankton_communities "Researchgate"). Progress in Oceanography (189) 102473.

This is a abbreviated version of the NUMmodel library and uses only the matlab implementation of the chemostat.

The figures in the paper are made by calling:
